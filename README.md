## üöÄ Overview

**FurniScan AI** is a next-generation web application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to detect and report damages in wooden furniture from images. The platform combines a robust React frontend, advanced AI models, and seamless cloud deployment to deliver instant, actionable insights for manufacturers, sellers, and homeowners.

### üß† How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload a photo of their wooden furniture through a modern, drag-and-drop interface built with React and TypeScript.
2. **AI Damage Detection:** The uploaded image is analyzed using the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) `rfdetr-nano` model‚Äîa fast, lightweight, and highly accurate object detection model optimized for real-time inference. This model identifies and localizes various types of wooden damage (such as cracks, scratches, and dents) directly in the image.
3. **Results Visualization:** Detected damages are displayed on an interactive canvas with bounding boxes and labels, allowing users to visually inspect the findings.
4. **Cost Analysis & Reporting:** The app calculates repair costs based on customizable material and labor rates, and generates a professional PDF report using jsPDF.
5. **Conversational AI Support:** Users can interact with an AI-powered chatbot (powered by [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)) for instant answers, prevention tips, and further guidance.
6. **Cloud Deployment:** The entire application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for fast, reliable, and scalable access from any device.
